# CompilersForFun

A personal project exploring compiler implementation through two different approaches:

## 1. Tree Walker Interpreter (Java)

An interpreter that directly executes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes by walking through the tree structure. This implementation:

- Parses source code into an AST
- Executes code by traversing the AST nodes
- Provides direct interpretation without intermediate representation
- Written in Java for better object-oriented tree representation

## 2. Stack-Based VM Interpreter (C)

A virtual machine implementation that:

- Compiles source code to bytecode instructions
- Executes bytecode using a stack-based architecture
- Implements a simple instruction set
- Written in C for lower-level memory management and performance

## Project Goals

- Learn compiler construction fundamentals
- Compare different interpretation strategies
- Understand trade-offs between direct interpretation and bytecode execution
- Gain hands-on experience with both high-level (Java) and low-level (C) implementations

## Current Status

ðŸš§ Work in Progress

## Building and Running

(To be added as implementation progresses)
